The future of Pterodactyl themes is here — Nebula v2

We set out to create a Pterodactyl theme that did everything you’d expect from a theme, and more, without negatively impacting the user experience. We’ve been working on this mission for over a year now and have no plans to stop anytime soon.

Nebula utilizes [Blueprint](https://blueprint.zip), the modding framework for Pterodactyl. This allows for impressive and seamless compatibility with other Pterodactyl modifications made with the framework.

## The start of a new era.

Introducing brand new features unseen before in competing themes, such as floating windows and customizable animations. From breathing new life into your game panel to massively improving productivity, Nebula has it all.

### Floating windows

Open up new possibilities on your Pterodactyl panel with Nebula’s brand new floating windows feature. Right click anything on the sidebar and turn it into a floating window, which you can drag anywhere and resize.

### Additional icon themes

We’ve added two brand new stunning icon themes to Nebula. These icon packs look playful but consistent at the same time. We now offer a total of 15 icon themes, with more to come in the future.

### Pattern backgrounds

Can’t find a background that fits? Pattern backgrounds are generated from your color palette, are sleek and look stunning with any configuration.

### Animations

Navigating Pterodactyl has never been so much fun. Elements can now fade up, fade in and zoom in.

### Palette presets

Nebula comes with 5 palette presets out of the box, so that there’s always a sleek color combination that works with you. In this update, we’ve revamped our “leaf” preset and added a new [Catppuccin Mocha](https://catppuccin.com)-inspired preset.

### Improved extension support

One of the many pro’s about Nebula is it’s extensive out-of-the-box extension support, which other themes commonly lack. We’ve massively improved extension styling and compatibility in v2.

## Raising the bar for Pterodactyl themes

With Nebula, we constantly try to improve every visible corner of the theme. We aren’t done yet though, there are so many more exciting things we’re planning to push out in future updates, without increasing our theme’s price.

Alongside the highlights we’ve talked about in this post, there are some more subtle improvements worth noting:

* **Revamped context menus:** Context menus now adapt to your color palette, animate and look incredibly sleek.

* **Translucent sidebar redesign: **We’ve completely changed the styling of the translucent sidebar and made it match the selected color palette.

* **Server list view redesign: **The home page’s server “list” option is now consistent with the “grid” option and shares the sleek look of Nebula’s other elements.

* **More customization:** v2 adds additional carefully thought-out customization options to Nebula Designer.

* **Bug fixes and stability improvements: **Nebula constantly improves, but sometimes bugs show up. We’ve been able to squash most of the bugs we were able to find, but if you find any, you can [let us know on our GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/prplwtf/nebula/issues/).

## Conclusion

Nebula v2 offers a huge list of brand new improvements, benefiting everyone. Join us on our journey to shape the future of Pterodactyl themes for everyone — [Learn more about Nebula on nebula.style](https://nebula.style).
